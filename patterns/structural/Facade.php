/**
 * Facade Pattern 
 * 
 * The Facade class provides a simple interface to the complex logic of one or
 * several subsystems (library, a framework, an API, or any other complex set of classes).
 * The Facade delegates the client requests to the appropriate objects within the subsystem. The Facade is also responsible for managing their lifecycle. All of this shields the client from the undesired complexity of the subsystem.
 * 
 * The best facade has no "new" in it and had a constructor with interface-type-hinted parameters. If you need creation of new instances, use a Factory as argument.
 * If there are multiple creations for each method, it is not a Facade, itâ€™s a Builder or a [Abstract|Static|Simple] Factory [Method].
