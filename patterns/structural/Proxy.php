/**
 * Proxy Pattern 
 * 
 * Provides an object that acts as a substitute for a real service object used by a client. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original service object.
 * The proxy object has the same interface as a service, which makes it interchangeable with a real object when passed to a client.
 * How to:
 * If there’s no pre-existing service interface, create one to make proxy and service objects interchangeable. Extracting the interface from the service class isn’t always possible, because you’d need to change all of the service’s clients to use that interface. Plan B is to make the proxy a subclass of the service class, and this way it’ll inherit the interface of the service.
 * Create the proxy class. It should have a field for storing a reference to the service. Usually, proxies create and manage the whole life cycle of their services. On rare occasions, a service is passed to the proxy via a constructor by the client.
 * Use Lazy initialization (virtual proxy) when you have a heavyweight service object that wastes system resources by being always up, even though you only need it from time to time.
 * Implement the proxy methods according to their purposes. In most cases, after doing some work, the proxy should delegate the work to the service object.
 * Consider introducing a creation method that decides whether the client gets a proxy or a real service. This can be a simple static method in the proxy class or a full-blown factory method.
