/**
 * ChainOfResponsibility
 * 
 * Used to build a chain of objects to handle a call in sequential order. If one object cannot handle a call, it delegates the call to the next in the chain and so forth.
 * 
 * How to:
 * Declare the handler interface and describe the signature of a method for handling requests.
 * Decide how the client will pass the request data into the method. The most flexible way is to convert the request into an object and pass it to the handling method as an argument.
 * To eliminate duplicate boilerplate code in concrete handlers, it might be worth creating an abstract base handler class, derived from the handler interface.
 * This class should have a field for storing a reference to the next handler in the chain. Consider making the class immutable. However, if you plan to modify chains at runtime, you need to define a setter for altering the value of the reference field.
 * You can also implement the convenient default behavior for the handling method, which is to forward the request to the next object unless thereâ€™s none left. Concrete handlers will be able to use this behavior by calling the parent method.
 * One by one create concrete handler subclasses and implement their handling methods. Each handler should decide if it will process the request or pass it along the chain.
 * The client may trigger any handler in the chain, not just the first one.
