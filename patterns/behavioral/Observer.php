/**
 * Observer
 * 
 * Lets you define a one-to-many subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.
 * Differentiate between the core (or independent) functionality and the optional (or dependent) functionality.
 * 
 * Model the independent functionality with a "subject" (subscriber) abstraction
 * Model the dependent functionality with an "observer" (publisher) hierarchy and describe a pair of methods for adding a subject object to and removing it from the list.
 * The Subject is coupled only to the Observer base class.
 * The client configures the number and type of Observers.
 * Observers register themselves with the Subject.
 * The Subject broadcasts events to all registered Observers.
 * The Subject may "push" information at the Observers, or, the Observers may "pull" the information they need from the Subject.

 *
 *         // Notify all observers about an event.
 *         public function notify();
